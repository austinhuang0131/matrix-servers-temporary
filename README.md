Oracle randomly decided to terminate my server (along with [other people's](https://www.reddit.com/r/oraclecloud/comments/1i74dc7/anyone_experiencing_issues_with_oracle_cloud/)) on January 22. Please bear with me while I try to make the code serverless (so that I can run it on a static host).

A backup of the `servers.json` file is available [here](./servers.json), though it is a bit old and may not reflect latest data. I'll update it on request. Alternatively you may use the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20241015043454/https://servers.joinmatrix.org/).
