        <h2>Information for Homeserver Operators</h2>
        <span class="card text-bg-info card-body serverWarning">
            <p>
                All new homeservers require explicit consent from the operators to be included in the list.
                If you're just a user, you're welcomed to contact your operators.
            </p>
        </span>
        <p>Welcome, and thank you for running a public homeserver! Your effort will support one of Matrix's core values - decentralisation.</p>
        <p>If you comply with the following criteria, you should ask me, at <code>@austin:tchncs.de</code>, to have your homeserver included on the list. If the homeserver fails to meet any criterion after inclusion, it will be removed with or without notice.</p>
        <h3>Criteria</h3>
        <h4 id="absolute-criteria">Absolute Criteria</h4>
        <h5>Intention to Run Publicly</h5>
        <p>The homeserver is advertised as operating for the public. If conditional registration is implemented, then the approval process must be clearly defined.</p>
        <h5>Stability</h5>
        <p>The homeserver <em>intends</em> to operate for the long term.</p>
        <p>Homeservers will be removed if they have excessive outages (eg. outages lasting for days are not acceptable).</p>
        <h5>Professionalism</h5>
        <p>The homeserver's name must be a second-level domain; see also <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/delegate.html">Synapse documentation on domain delegation</a>.</p>
        <p>The homeserver must not use a free TLD, especially those offered by Freenom, due to risks of takeover by fraudulent entities.</p>
        <h5>Independence</h5>
        <p>The homeserver is neither matrix.org nor operated by Element Matrix Services (previously known as Modular).</p>
        <h5>Reputation</h5>
        <p>The homeserver must not be banned from official matrix.org rooms nor be banned by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#community-moderation-effort-bl:neko.dev">Community Moderation Effort</a>.</p>
        <h4>Subjective Criteria</h4>
        <p>The following is determined solely at my discretion.</p>
        <h5>Legality</h5>
        <p>
            The homeserver must not be <em>intentionally</em> promoting illegal activity.
            While varying legal landscapes of the world makes it difficult to come up with a universal definition of illegality, anything that is clearly criminal under most Western jurisdictions is explicitly forbidden.
        </p>
        <h5>Reputation</h5>
        <p>Public content associated with the homeserver as well as its operators may be inspected for any reputation concerns. This is necessary to maintain a safe environment for prospective users as well as to control my liability in running this list.</p>
        <h4>Recommended Measures</h4>
        <p>While the following are not required, but abiding by them will provide a better experience for prospective users:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A page should be provided that describes the homeserver.</li>
            <li>A <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/hs/proposal-admin-contact-1/proposals/1929-admin-contact.md">MSC1929</a> endpoint should be provided for contacting the operators.</li>
            <li>Rules & privacy policy is strongly recommended. They do not have to be formal: a statement in plain language describing expectations of user conduct, as well as your data protections measures, is sufficient.</li>
        </ul>
