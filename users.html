            <p><b>Please do not register on multiple homeservers.</b>
            Abusing the limited resources that those servers offer will only discourage others from running new public homeservers.
            If you're testing one's performance, please do so one at a time, and clean up (delete the account) if you choose not to use that homeserver.
            </p>

            <p><b>GENERAL DISCLAIMER:</b> Inclusion does <b>NOT</b> imply any opinion (affiliation, endorsement, etc.) on individual homeservers, nor any guarantee regarding their availability.
                This list is provided “as is.” Any dispute regarding your account on one of the homeservers should be resolved between you and the operator(s) of the homeserver.

        <p>
            Welcome! This site is intended to help you decide which homeserver to base your account on.
            Please note that, while all listed servers respect the <a href="./operators.html#absolute-criteria">absolute criteria</a>,
            you're encouraged to do your due diligence before trusting a homeserver. After all, they'll have access to all unencrypted data in your account!
        </p>
        <p>
            Specifically, you should:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inspect the homeserver's homepage and legal policies, where applicable;</li>
            <li>Check if the server is <a href="https://federationtester.matrix.org/">federating properly</a>;</li>
            <li>Verify if the server has an up-to-date version.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The software behind this list is <a href="https://codeberg.org/austinhuang/matrix-serverlist">open source</a>. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to <a href="https://austinhuang.me/#contact-me">ask me</a>!</p>
        <h3>Still, how do I select a homeserver?</h3>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, Matrix does not provide an endpoint to query how many users a homeserver has. Member distribution on major rooms can be used as reference.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below is a list of homeservers that are included in the homeserver list and have more than 10 members in <code>#community:grapheneos.org</code> on January 2, 2025 (using this room as reference is not an endorsement of it):
        </p>
        <table class="table">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th scope="col"># of members</th>
                <th scope="col">Homeservers (exact member count)</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <th scope="row">&gt;= 100</th>

        </table>
        <p>Note that member does not imply "active user." The omission of any homeservers does not mean that they are not stable enough to be used; it simply means that the stability has not been proven in the community.</p>
        <h3 id="legend">Explanations of certain terminologies</h3>
        <h4>Version status</h4>
        <p>There are three version statuses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="badge text-bg-success">Up-to-date</span>
                means the homeserver is running on a version that is no older than the last stable version that is released at least 1 month ago.</li>
            <li><span class="badge text-bg-warning">Outdated</span>
                means the homeserver is running on a version that is strictly older than the last stable version that is released at least 1 month ago.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="badge text-bg-danger">Vulnerable</span>
                means the homeserver is running on a version that has published vulnerabilities.
                While this does not imply the server being vulnerable (since many vulnerabilities require very specific preconditions),
                this is an indication that a server is not keeping up with maintenance.
                If a homeserver has been running on a vulnerable version for too long, it will be delisted.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>"Longstanding"</h4>
        <p>
            Any homeserver that was included
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210000000000*/https://publiclist.anchel.nl/">on publiclist.anchel.nl</a> (archive)
            as well as <a href="https://www.hello-matrix.net/public_servers.php">Hello Matrix's homeserver list</a> (no longer updated)
            is given a <span class="badge text-bg-success">Longstanding</span> label to recognize their longevity.
        </p>
        <h4>Manual Registration</h4>
        <p>
            When a homeserver does not provide a method to register directly, you may create an account using your preferred Matrix client (if it supports doing so).
            See <a href="https://joinmatrix.org/guide/#register-an-account">here</a> for the exact procedure.</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Frequently-Asked Questions</h3>
        <h4>Why shouldn't I just use matrix.org?</h4>
        <p>Because it is way too large, and thus</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It has performance issues, for which they are using <a href="https://element.io/blog/scaling-to-millions-of-users-requires-synapse-pro/">proprietary components</a> to resolve, and</li>
            <li>Being a dominating homeserver, its existence is antithetical to decentralisation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Of course, Matrix.org tries to address this by <a href="https://arewep2pyet.com">introducing P2P</a>, but it may be a while before it goes into production; even then, P2P is unlikely to be suitable for everyone.</p>
        <h4>Are there other homeserver lists?</h4>
        <p>
            Currently, this is the only comprehensive public homeserver list.
            The rest are either raw (automatically generated) or <em>intentionally</em> misleading, so they're not as remotely useful as this list.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.chatons.org/search/by-service?service_type_target_id=All&field_alternatives_aux_services_target_id=All&field_software_target_id=274&field_is_shared_value=All&title=">CHATONS</a>
            has a list of homeservers hosted by various tech cooperatives (mostly French), though most of them require payment.
        </p>
        <p>There's also <a href="https://matrix.squirrel.rocks/furry_servers">a short guide</a> on furry homeservers and communities on Matrix.</p>
        <p>To my understanding, matrix.org will eventually host an official homeserver list.</p>
